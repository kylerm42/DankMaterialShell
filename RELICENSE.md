## License Change Process

To relicense this project from GPL-3.0 to MIT, explicit consent is required from all contributors listed above (excluding automated bots and trivial contributions).

## Notes

- **github-actions[bot]** and **copilot-swe-agent[bot]** are automated processes and do not hold copyright
- Contributors with <50 lines of meaningful code changes are not listed as their contributions are likely below the threshold of originality
- Configuration file contributions (Nix, TOML, CSS themes) are included as they involve creative decisions

## Total Contributors Requiring Consent

**21 contributors** (including the primary author)

## Alternative: Rewrite Instead of Relicense

If any contributor cannot be reached or does not consent, their specific contributions can be identified and rewritten to enable relicensing. The primary codebase (>90%) is controlled by the two primary authors (bbedward and purian23).
